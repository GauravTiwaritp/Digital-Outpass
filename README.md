# Digital-Outpass
Digitalizing the out-pass system 
The objective of the project is to digitalize the current out-pass system. Making sure that  obtaining the out-pass system is easy for the student and hassle free for the warden as well as  making sure to have a database of the student applying for the out-pass system. 
Things we will be doing for our project 
1 Common page for student, warden and main gate security officer from where they can  choose for their respective field 
2 Login page for all of them 
3 For the student page there will be a form, from where they can send their request for the out-pass  system to their respective warden. 
4 Warden will be receiving notification for such messages and will be getting the option to either  accept the request or to decline the resources. 
5 If a request is accepted notification will be sent to the main gate security officer, from there they  can check which student has requested for the out-pass and who hasn’t. 
Languages and framework we will be using our 
1 Javascript 
2 Python  
3 Django (Python framework).
PROJECT WORKING
1 When we first access the web app we observe three choice Student, warden, security officer
 



2 Clicking on the student button
Login view for student

 


3 Outpass page showing up

 

4 Successfully accepted out pass will show up ,each student has the ability to delete their own outpass
And once the outpass is deleted they will be able to generate a new request for outpass

5 Accessing Out pass without login and sending correct details for ouptass but we will be stopping such request from getting post up 
Still they can use logout button to go to the login page from where they can log in in the system for making request
6 Warden will be shown all those outpass which hasn’t been accepted 
 
All the accepted out pass will not be shown on this page


The outpass request was accepted and hence now removed from the page
 
7 The accepted outpass will be shown to the security officer
 
Delete button is available to them for deleting the outpass
